# The backend movies API.  
## What it can do already:
  1. Get's the data from external API, if the data already doesn't exist in the database.
  2. Writes data that doesn't exist into the database so we don't need to make anymore API calls.

## What needs to be done:
  1. Adding more endpoints for more features.
  2. Cleaning up the code a little bit.
